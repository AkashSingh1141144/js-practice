# start with DOM (DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL)

# window object ? => 
(1) => the window object represents an open window in a browser. it is browser's object(not js) and is automatecally created by browser.
it is a global object with lots of porperties and methods.
(2) => `window` object in js serves  as the globle scope for browser-based, providing access to the browser and its properties, such as `document` , `location`, `console`, `alert`, `resize`, `load`, `scroll`, ``

# what is DOM ? =>
The world wide web Document Object Model is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document 



# Function in JS =>
  JavaScript function si a set of statement that take inputs, do some specific computation, and produce output. 
  A js function is executed when "something" invokes it(call it).
Advantages ----------
there are manlly two advantages of js --->
1. code reusability -> we can call a function several times so it save coding.
2. less coding -> it makes our program compact. we don't need to write many lines of code each time to perform a common task.
