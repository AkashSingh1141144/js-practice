/*  What is array in js
JavaScript arrays are ordered collections of values called elements. They are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Elements in an array can be accessed using their index (location in the array). JavaScript arrays are dynamic in nature, which means their size can vary. They can also be nested, meaning they can contain other arrays.

let b = new Array('abc', 'def', 'ghi')
console.log(b);
