# JavaScipt Variable... 
# A js variable is simply a named storage location in our computer's memory that can hold a value.
# There are two types of variables in JavaScript:

# 1. Local variables 
# 2. Global variables
# JavaScript local variables are declared within a function or block statement. 
# Local variables are available only within the function or block statement in which they are declared.
# JavaScript global variables are declared outside of a function or block statement.
# Global variables are available to all parts of our JavaScript code.
# JavaScript variables are created when a variable is declared and destroyed when the function that created the variable is finished.
# JavaScript variables are case-sensitive.
# JavaScript variables do not have a fixed type.
# JavaScript variables are dynamically typed.

# JavaScript variables declared by two types of keywords:
# 1.var
# 2.let
# 3.const
# JavaScript var keyword
# The var keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript.
# The var keyword was the only way to declare variables in JavaScript before ES6.
# The var keyword has several disadvantages:
# 1. It is possible to redeclare variables with the same name within the same scope.	
# 2. It is possible to accidentally overwrite variables declared in the outer scope.	
  


# JavaScript let keyword
# The let keyword was introduced in ES6 to declare variables in JavaScript.
# The let keyword has several advantages over the var keyword:
# 1. It is not possible to redeclare variables with the same name within the same scope.	
# 2. It is not possible to accidentally overwrite variables declared in the outer scope.
# 3. It is block-scoped, which means that the variable is only available within the block it is declared in.



# JavaScript const keyword
# The const keyword was introduced in ES6 to declare variables in JavaScript.
# The const keyword has several advantages over the let keyword:
# 1. It is not possible to reassign variables declared with the const keyword.	
# 2. It is not possible to reassign variables declared with the const keyword.
# 3. It is block-scoped, which means that the variable is only available within the block it is declared in.
# 4. It is recommended to use const keyword for variables that are never going to be reassigned.
