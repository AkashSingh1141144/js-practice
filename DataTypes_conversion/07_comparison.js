/* Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or diffrence between variables or values.

//    (==) equal to
/*
let a = 2;
let b = 3;
console.log(a == b);
*/

// (!==) not equal value or not equal type

let a = 5;
// let b = "5";  // this is a character type that why this value has different of a because a is a integer 
let b = 5;
console.log(a !== b);

//  (===) equal value and equal type
/*
let a = 5;
// let b = "5";
let b = 5;
console.log(a === b);
*/


// (!=)  not equal 

/*
let a = 5;
let b = 3;
// let b = 5;
